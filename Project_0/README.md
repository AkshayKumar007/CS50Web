### CS50
#### Project 0(Web Programming with Python and Javascript)

In Project 0, I have created 4 html files.

1. My Resume
2. My Eduation and Certifications
3. My book recommendations
4. my Travel recommendations (if you visit India)

It is possible to move around from on page to another.
The opening page should be "my resume", in which i have provided links which are embedded in headers and buttons to move to other pages.

Note : In html file named "Resume", I have used Bootstrap v3.4.1. In all other files I have use Bootstarp v4.x .

In rest of the pages I have provided seperate navigation buttons to switch to other pages.

I have tried to make all my pages mobile responsive, with Bootstrap.
