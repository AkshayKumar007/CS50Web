##### Project 1
----------------------------------


- As per the new version of Flask, I have renamed 'application.py' as '__init__.py'.

- The website first takes users to a Login page. if they are not registered, the website provides link for Registration. After registration or login it takes users to Search Page where he/she can search for book by title, author, or ISBN(10). The search results are presented in tabular fashion, with details and a 'Review' button. Clicking on the button takes user to webpage with details about book and reviews posted by users on my site(if any), along with average ratings and review counts on 'Goodreads'.

- I have added 'requests' package in requirements.txt .

*Hope it fulfills all the requirments of the Project. Thanks*	:smile:
