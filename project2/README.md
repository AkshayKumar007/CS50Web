##### Project 2
----------------------------------

- As per the new version of Flask, I have renamed 'application.py' as "\_\_init\_\_.py". To run Flask application, move to 'project2' folder and do

```
python3 __init__.py
```
- I would recommend using Firefox browser for running my web application(my web app works perfectly with Firefox).

- I ahve used databases for keeping record of users and files that are uploaded.

- As stated in project requirements, if a user is in a channel and closes the tab without logging out, and afterwards re-opens the page, he's re-directed to the previous channel.

- For 'Personal Touch' in my project, I have added file upload and view feature in my web-application. I have intentionally limited file types that can be uploaded to .txt, .pdf, .png, .jpg and .jpeg .

- I have added 'eventlet' package in requirements.txt .

*Hope it fulfills all the requirments of the Project. Thanks*	:smile:
